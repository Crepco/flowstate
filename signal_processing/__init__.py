"""FlowState signal-processing package.

Turns raw forehead-EEG samples into a relative focus score:

    raw samples -> notch(50Hz) + bandpass(1-40Hz) -> band powers
                -> engagement index (beta / (alpha + theta))
                -> focus score (0-100, relative to a personal baseline)

# OpenBLAS/OMP allocate a memory pool *per thread*. When SciPy/NumPy are called
# from many threads at once (the Flask server + our background compute loop),
# that pool can be exhausted, crashing with:
#   "OpenBLAS error: Memory allocation still failed after 10 retries".
# Pin BLAS to a single thread BEFORE numpy is first imported below. Our FFT
# windows are tiny (~1000 samples), so single-threaded BLAS costs us nothing.
